# Users-Feedback-on-the-Usage-of-Virtual-Reality-on-Education-at-Different-Level
VR offers a transforming approach to providing interactive learning experiences. VR is far beyond just games. Users can immerse themselves in the virtual space, experience a sense of realism that traditional educational methods may not provide.
VR enhances users’ engagement, helps the students with better retention, and even encourage a safe learning environment.

Application of VR IN Education;

Medical training: VR is used in medical schools to simulate surgeries, allowing students to practice procedures in a risk-free environment.
History: VR enhances students understanding on history, and geographical features.

Language learning: VR can create immersive environments where students practice language skills in realistic contexts.

Corporate training: Many organizations use VR for employee training, allowing them to practice skills in a safe environment, such as emergency response training or customer service simulations.

The dataset highlights virtual reality technology ability to enhance learning experiences in various subjects. It covers data on students’ access to VR, student engagement, retention rates, and  improvement in academic performance. It includes data from various educational institutions that have implemented VR in their teaching methodologies.

Data Overview
The analysis focuses on the following columns: 
Age: The age of each survey participants.
Gender: The different gender of each participants.
Grade Level
Field of Study
Engagement Level
Improvement in Learning Outcomes
Subject
Instructor VR Proficiency
Access to VR Equipment
Stress Level with VR Usage
Region
Continuous Interest

Project Objectives
1.	To identify the age distribution of students that participated in the survey
2.	To identify the gender distribution of students.
3.	To identify and gain insight in the students’ engagement level with virtual reality on a scales of 1 to 5
4.	To know if and how much students have access to virtual reality in the different regions outined on the data.
5.	To know the improvement rate in learning at each grade levels.
6.	To identify the amount of students who are still interested in learning with virtual reality at each grade level
7.	To identify the stress level associated with virtual reality usage by students.
8.	To look into the instructors’ proficiency with virtual reality.

Key Insights and KPIs;

VR on most used subjects: History

 VR on most used region/ continent: South America
 
Feedback from educators: 35% positive

Percentage of students with access to VR Equipment: 51%

Total number of students that participated in the survey: 5000

Key Takeaway and Observations;

1.	The feedback was gotten from a total number of 5000 students, and 51% of the students have access to VR equipment, while 41% don’t have access to VR.
2.	The engagement level of the students in VR is high and on a scale of 1 to 5 a larger number (1056) went for the scale 5.
3.	A total of 2,512 students indicated significant improvement in learning across different grade levels. Also, a large number 845 from the undergraduate level said VR has not helped to improve the learning process but they also showed interest in continually using VR to learn, this  is in hopes that there will be better improvement if they are consistent.
4.	2, 534 students at different grade level indicated continuous interest in VR in order to improve their academic performance.
5.	Feedback from Educators on the impact of virtual reality was 35% positive.
6.	The usage of VR cut across high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate.
7.	The data contains students from high school, undergraduates and post graduates, ranging from 12 years to 30 years. Although there is a high number of 21 year old students.
8.	The stress level usage of these VR equipments is high and this is contibuting to the students' reluctancy in engaging with these VR and also low interest in continually using VR to learn.

Recommendation;

In order to reduce the stress level usage of VR, the school management should organize training activities (VR workshop) for the students and teachers to guide and explain how best to use VR to its full potential. There should also be a handout manual that contains information on step-by-step guidance on the proper usage, and content selection. All this will help to enhance the proficiency level of instructors.

Proper aligning of VR with learning objectives will help to increase the interest and boost the learning process of students.

The school, student board and VR industries should plan strategic approach to promoting the use of VR in schools, this could include; raising awareness through workshops, showcasing the VR's educational benefits, develop partnerships between schools and VR industries.
